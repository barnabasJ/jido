> **Jido is an autonomous agent framework for Elixir, built for workflows and multi-agent systems.**
<!-- package.jido.framework -->

Define agents, connect them to actions, signals, and directives, and run them
with supervision and fault tolerance built in.

_The name "Jido" (自動) comes from the Japanese word meaning "automatic" or "automated", where 自 (ji) means "self" and 動 (dō) means "movement"._

_Learn more about Jido at [jido.run](https://jido.run)._

## Overview

Jido helps you build agent systems as ordinary Elixir and OTP software.

- Agents hold state and implement `cmd/2`
- Actions do work and transform that state
- Signals route events into the system
- Directives describe effects for the runtime to execute

Use Jido when software needs to inspect context, choose among multiple steps,
coordinate with other agents, and keep running reliably over time.

AI is optional. The core package gives you the agent architecture and runtime;
companion packages such as `jido_ai` add model integration when you need it.

At the core, Jido agents are immutable data structures with a single command function:

```elixir
defmodule MyAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "my_agent",
    description: "My custom agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
    ]
end

{agent, directives} = MyAgent.cmd(agent, action)
```

State changes are pure data transformations; side effects are described as directives and executed by an OTP runtime. You get deterministic agent logic, testability without processes, and a clear path to running those agents in production.
<!-- package.jido.pure_cmd package.jido.runtime_separation -->

## The Bright Line

> **Actions mutate state. Directives do I/O. Nothing else writes.**

- **Actions are the sole channel for `agent.state` writes.** Reading the action tells you everything that changes.
- **Directives are pure side effects.** They emit signals, spawn processes, schedule messages, persist to disk — and **mutate no state**: not domain (`agent.state`), not runtime (`%AgentServer.State{}`). Their results, if any, come back as signals that re-enter the pipeline.
- **The type system enforces it.** `Jido.AgentServer.DirectiveExec.exec/3` returns `:ok | {:stop, term()}` — there is no state slot in the return shape, so a directive author cannot accidentally write one.
- **Runtime bookkeeping** (`state.children`, `state.cron_*`, monitors, subscriptions) lives on `%AgentServer.State{}` and is written **only** by AgentServer GenServer callbacks and the signal-cascade callbacks invoked by `process_signal/2` (`maybe_track_child_started/2`, `handle_child_down/3`, …). Directives are never that channel.

Sole exception: middleware may stage `ctx.agent` for I/O purposes.

## The Jido Ecosystem

Jido is the core package of the Jido ecosystem. The ecosystem is built around the core Jido Agent behavior and offer several opt-in packages to extend the core behavior.

## Why Jido?

OTP primitives are excellent. You can build agent systems with raw GenServer. But when building *multiple cooperating agents*, you'll reinvent:

| Raw OTP                             | Jido Formalizes                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Ad-hoc message shapes per GenServer | Signals as standard envelope            |
| Business logic mixed in callbacks   | Actions as reusable command pattern     |
| Implicit effects scattered in code  | Directives as typed effect descriptions |
| Custom child tracking per server    | Built-in parent/child hierarchy         |
| Process exit = completion           | State-based completion semantics        |

Jido isn't "better GenServer" - it's a formalized agent pattern built *on* GenServer.

## Key Features

### Immutable Agent Architecture
- Pure functional agent design inspired by Elm/Redux
- `cmd/2` as the core operation: actions in, updated agent + directives out
- Schema-validated state with NimbleOptions or Zoi

### Directive-Based Effects
- Actions transform state; directives describe external effects
- Built-in directives: Emit, Spawn, SpawnAgent, StopChild, Schedule, Stop
- Protocol-based extensibility for custom directives

### OTP Runtime Integration
- GenServer-based AgentServer for production deployment
- Parent-child agent hierarchies with lifecycle management
- Signal routing with configurable strategies
- Instance-scoped supervision plus logical partitions for multi-tenant deployments

### Composable Plugins
- Reusable capability modules that extend agents
- State isolation per plugin with automatic schema merging
- Lifecycle hooks for initialization and signal handling

### Execution Strategies
- Direct execution for simple workflows
- FSM (Finite State Machine) strategy for state-driven workflows
- Extensible strategy protocol for custom execution patterns

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Multi-agent workflows with configurable strategies
- Plan-based orchestration for complex workflows
- Durable groups of agents with named topology, hierarchical runtime ownership, nested pod nodes, and partition-safe tenancy boundaries

## Installation

### Using Igniter (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is with [Igniter](https://hex.pm/packages/igniter):

```bash
mix igniter.install jido
```

This automatically:
- Adds Jido to your dependencies
- Creates a `MyApp.Jido` instance module (`use Jido, otp_app: :my_app`)
- Creates configuration in `config/config.exs`
- Adds `MyApp.Jido` to your supervision tree

Generate an example agent to get started:

```bash
mix igniter.install jido --example
```

### Manual Installation

Add `jido` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then define a Jido instance module and add it to your supervision tree:

```elixir
# In lib/my_app/jido.ex
defmodule MyApp.Jido do
  use Jido, otp_app: :my_app
end
```

```elixir
# In config/config.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Jido,
  max_tasks: 1000,
  agent_pools: []
```

```elixir
# In your application.ex
children = [
  MyApp.Jido
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Define an Agent

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter",
    description: "A simple counter agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
    ],
    signal_routes: [
      {"increment", MyApp.Actions.Increment}
    ]
end
```

### 2. Define an Action

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Actions.Increment do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "increment",
    description: "Increments the counter by a given amount",
    schema: [
      amount: [type: :integer, default: 1]
    ]

  def run(params, context) do
    current = context.state[:count] || 0
    {:ok, %{count: current + params.amount}}
  end
end
```

### 3. Execute Commands

```elixir
# Create an agent
agent = MyApp.CounterAgent.new()

# Execute an action - returns updated agent + directives
{agent, directives} = MyApp.CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {MyApp.Actions.Increment, %{amount: 5}})

# Check the state
agent.state.count
# => 5
```

### 4. Run with AgentServer

```elixir
# Start the agent server
{:ok, pid} = MyApp.Jido.start_agent(MyApp.CounterAgent, id: "counter-1")

# Send signals to the running agent (synchronous)
# Signal types must be declared in signal_routes
{:ok, agent} = Jido.AgentServer.call(pid, Jido.Signal.new!("increment", %{amount: 10}, source: "/user"))

# Look up the agent by ID
pid = MyApp.Jido.whereis("counter-1")

# List all running agents
agents = MyApp.Jido.list_agents()
```

## Core Concepts

### The `cmd/2` Contract

The fundamental operation in Jido:

```elixir
{agent, directives} = MyAgent.cmd(agent, action)
```

Key invariants:
- The returned `agent` is always complete — no "apply directives" step needed
- `directives` are pure I/O descriptions — they never modify state of any kind (domain or runtime); see [The Bright Line](#the-bright-line)
- `cmd/2` is a pure function — same inputs always produce same outputs

### Actions vs Directives

| Actions                                              | Directives                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutate state — sole channel for `agent.state` writes | Pure I/O — emit signals, spawn processes, schedule messages |
| Return updated state + directives from `cmd/2`       | Bare structs emitted by agents; runtime interprets them     |
| May call APIs, read files, query databases           | Mutate no state — domain or runtime                         |

See [The Bright Line](#the-bright-line) for the full rule.

### Directive Types

| Directive    | Purpose                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Emit`       | Dispatch a signal via configured adapters        |
| `Error`      | Signal an error from cmd/2                       |
| `Spawn`      | Spawn a generic BEAM child process               |
| `SpawnAgent` | Spawn a tracked child Jido agent (`restart: :transient` by default) |
| `StopChild`  | Gracefully stop and remove a tracked child agent                      |
| `Schedule`   | Schedule a delayed message                       |
| `Stop`       | Stop the agent process                           |
